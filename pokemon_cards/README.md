## Description

This project is a web application that allows users to create an account, login, and manage their Pokemon cards. The user can add, remove and see all his cards.

A new user can also search for a Pokemon card by its name, without the need to create an account.

The user can create an account and login to store his cards in the database.

The work is divided into two parts: front and back. 

- Front

The front end is divided in different components and pages. All the requests are done using 'fetch' library to the back end. The state is managed using 'useState', which allows the control of the user navigation, avoiding unauthorized access to the pages.

- Back

The back contains the database management and the API code. The database is managed using SQLLite, which is a simple database that allows the storage of the user's cards. The back also contains the tests for the API and the database, which are done using the 'unittest' library. To collect the data about the Pokemon cards, the back uses the 'pokeapi' library, a third-party library that allows the access to pokemon data.

- Root

The root contains .github/workflows, which contains the configuration file to use the GitHub Actions. The GitHub Actions are used to run the tests for the back end. The tests are run every time a push is made to the repository.

## How to run

**Important** = To run the code, it is necessary to run the front and back separately. 

### Front

```cd front```

``` npm install ```

``` npm start ``` -> will be running on port 3000

### Back

```cd back```

``` python3 -m venv <env> ```

``` source <env>/bin/activate ```

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

``` cd Pokemon ```

``` uvicorn pokemon:app --reload ``` -> will be running on port 8000

### Tests

Follow the same steps as the back (to run the tests, the back end must be running)

After the back is running:

``` cd <path>/back/Pokemon/ ```

``` python3 test_pokemon.py ```
